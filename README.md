# Javascript Small Project

## Vanilla Javascript

Simple project built in Vanilla Javascript. It is a expense tracker.
This app allows you to add your income and expense.
If you want to delete item from history just left click on that specific item.

Inspiration to this project I got from udemy course created by Brad Traversy.

In this project I added deleting item by clicking, formating money and also put a legend.
